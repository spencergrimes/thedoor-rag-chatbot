# 🏛️ The Door Church RAG Chatbot

**Live Demo**: [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yourusername/thedoor-rag-chatbot)

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that creates an intelligent chatbot for The Door church website. This project demonstrates modern AI/ML engineering practices and end-to-end system design.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This RAG chatbot can answer questions about The Door church by:
1. **Retrieving** relevant information from scraped website content
2. **Augmenting** user queries with contextual information  
3. **Generating** natural language responses using local LLMs

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

                & Cleaning                        Search            Response
```

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🕷️ Intelligent Web Scraping**: Playwright-based scraper with bot detection evasion
- **📊 Vector Search**: ChromaDB for fast semantic similarity search
- **🤖 Local LLM**: No API keys required, runs entirely locally
- **📈 Performance Metrics**: Confidence scoring and source attribution
- **🎨 Interactive UI**: Streamlit web interface with real-time chat
