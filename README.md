# 🏛️ The Door Church RAG Chatbot

**Live Demo**: Coming soon on Hugging Face Spaces!

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that creates an intelligent chatbot for The Door church website. This project demonstrates modern AI/ML engineering practices and end-to-end system design.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This RAG chatbot can answer questions about The Door church by:
1. **Retrieving** relevant information from scraped website content
2. **Augmenting** user queries with contextual information  
3. **Generating** natural language responses using local LLMs

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

                & Cleaning                        Search            Response
```

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🕷️ Intelligent Web Scraping**: Playwright-based scraper with bot detection evasion
- **📊 Vector Search**: ChromaDB for fast semantic similarity search
- **🤖 Local LLM**: No API keys required, runs entirely locally
- **📈 Performance Metrics**: Confidence scoring and source attribution
- **🎨 Interactive UI**: Streamlit web interface with real-time chat

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thedoor-rag-chatbot.git
   cd thedoor-rag-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Playwright** (optional, for fresh scraping)
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```

5. **Run the complete setup**
   ```bash
   python main.py --setup
   ```

6. **Launch the chatbot**
   ```bash
   python main.py --chatbot
   ```

### Individual Pipeline Steps

You can also run components separately:

```bash
# Scrape website (or use sample data)
python main.py --scrape

# Process documents into chunks
python main.py --process

# Create embeddings and vector database
python main.py --embeddings

# Launch chatbot interface
python main.py --chatbot
```

## 🎨 Demo Features

### Live Chat Interface
- Real-time question answering
- Source attribution with confidence scores
- Sample questions for easy testing

### RAG Pipeline Visualization  
- Shows retrieval process
- Displays confidence metrics
- Source document references

## 📊 Performance
